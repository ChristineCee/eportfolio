<h1>Reflective Essay</h1>

<p>When I applied to the Master of Science in Information Management program, anticipating that it would help me in my new position as digital communications manager in Dominican&rsquo;s Office of Marketing and Communications. I had completed a Master of Library and Information Science degree four years before starting my position in marketing, and I felt that completing the MSIM with a concentration in web design would further enhance my knowledge in that area. The courses I took as part of the MSIM program not only gave me a better foundation in web development and design, but also increased skills in other, unexpected ways. The MSIM program fostered a new-found interest for me in digital asset management. My project management skills have deepened, as have my presentation skills. I&rsquo;ve discovered a passion and aptitude for user interface design and user experience research; two areas of interest that I have had since beginning my career in digital communications, but had not previously explored or fully understood.</p>

<p>From the start, IM 701 sparked my interest in learning about information: how it&rsquo;s defined, its importance in society and how emerging trends and technology are shaping how people create, find and consume information. Having previously completed a library and information science degree, I was glad to find a common thread in LIS 701, and was also pleasantly surprised by the differences. As my previous educational and work background was in public and academic libraries, where open access is king, I was not as familiar with closed information systems found in the corporate world. IM 701 sparked an interest in digital asset management, a term that I&rsquo;d just started hearing a lot about in my job as a marketing manager.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another course that I found especially helpful to my job was IM 703, Information Architecture. I benefitted from perfect timing; this course coincided with my work team starting to prepare for a full web redesign, something I had never worked on before. As I learned in class about customer personas and user roles, information strategy planning, and constructing a full information architecture, I was able to apply what I was learning directly to my job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The information architecture project I began in IM 703 for my fictional company, Sam&rsquo;s Fresh Market, carried over into IM 760, Human-Computer Interaction. It was during this course that I discovered a passion for creating user interfaces. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute spent in this class, as well as all of the time spent working on assignments. I loved drawing low-fi paper wireframes on Post-It notes and developing those ideas over several iterations to create a clickable prototype of a mobile fitness app on Adobe XD. It was very rewarding to be able to present my interface prototype to the class, and it was equally exciting to see their ideas from start to finish. Since we had such a small class for this particular semester (there were only four of us in this course), we all had the opportunity to familiarize ourselves with each other&rsquo;s projects, which allowed us to give constructive feedback. Our feedback and brainstorming sessions helped me to revise and perfect my final interface.</p>

<p>I found courses in data analytics, data structure and management to be challenging. While those areas are not my strong suit, I was very appreciative of my professors&rsquo; knowledge and patience. Courses in information policy and intercultural communication were highly interesting to me; assignments in intercultural communication led me to another topic of interest that I would like to pursue more fully: providing first-generation college students with access to information for a successful college experience.</p>

<p>I wrapped up my MSIM journey with LIS 786, Advanced Web Design. I had completed this course eight years previously during my MLIS program, but I&rsquo;m glad I took the class again as much has changed over those eight years. In LIS 786, we focused on working in the command line, something I had struggled with during data analytics and other data management classes. LIS 786 helped me to gain more confidence in working in the command line on Git. We also learned to work with Jekyll, a static site generator which offers a much more streamlined, elegant way to write web code. I enjoyed working with Jekyll and GitHub and am determined to continue learning more. I found the LIS 786 final project, creating a microsite as part of a group, to be one of my most valuable and rewarding experiences during my MSIM career. I felt that through this project, I gained a high confidence level working successfully with a group and leading portions of a project, and that carried over to my work life.</p>

<p>As I anticipated, the courses I took and assignments I completed helped me immensely in my career. As I was starting the MSIM program in the Fall 2016 semester, Dominican University embarked on a redesign of the university website, dom.edu. My role as the university&rsquo;s main web editor expanded; as we went through the discovery and planning processes for this project, I was involved in persona discussions, usability research, reviewing wireframes and mockups, and assisting with information architecture. Learning these topics in class while working on them in my job was a rewarding experience. It made me feel more confident while working alongside experienced web designers and developers with much more experience. I am able to articulate theories and concepts that I learned in class and directly apply them to my daily work, and am able to confidently work on projects that I once would have found difficult or intimidating.</p>

<p>More than anything, the experience I found the most valuable was getting to know my classmates and professors. Going through the sequence of courses as a cohort allowed us to get to know once another much more than we might have in regular classes, especially when we had full-day weekend classes. I really appreciated learning about my fellow classmates and having the opportunity to work with each one of them, since we worked on many exercises and projects in pairs and small groups. I found my classmates to be extremely supportive, which helped me to gain confidence. I was consistently amazed and impressed by my classmates&rsquo; creativity and intellect, and the knowledge of our professors, which inspired me to do my best. I&rsquo;m glad that I embarked on this program; while it was highly challenging to work full time and attend to family life while attending classes and trying to complete classwork on time, what I&rsquo;ve gained in return &ndash; knowledge, confidence, and a network of colleagues &ndash; is immeasurable.</p>
