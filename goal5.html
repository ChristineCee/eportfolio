<h1>Goal 5</h1>

<p>Demonstrate leadership, communication and collaboration skills in order to successfully deliver and advocate for information services</p>

<h2>Outcome A</h2>

<p>Demonstrate effective collaboration and negotiate group dynamics in pursuit of a common goal</p>

<h4>Assignment: LIS 786 Final Project: Microsite</h4>

<p><em>The assignment: Using the work you&rsquo;ve done in the second half of the semester, your group will design and deploy a library microsite. To successfully complete this project your microsite should:</em></p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Clearly articulate the issue or topic</em></li>
	<li><em>Have a clearly defined audience</em></li>
	<li><em>Use modern design and development practices</em></li>
	<li><em>Be accessible online through Github Pages</em></li>
</ul>

<p>For this assignment, I worked alongside two other classmates. Our microsite&rsquo;s purpose is to assist students at a fictional university in finding and reserving available study areas on campus. Special features of the microsite include a reservation form, availability calendar, live feeds and user reviews.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While all three members of Group A collaborated on all parts of the Townsville University Library Study Rooms microsite from concept to launch, we each had primary areas of responsibility. I was responsible for the site&rsquo;s design and writing the overall site CSS. I took the lead on creating the group&rsquo;s design concept, moodboard and mockup, with feedback from the other team members. I was also responsible for translating the design concept, moodboard and mockups into CSS. Other aspects of the site that I handled were the creation of the home page, layouts, formatting the site&rsquo;s forms and editing and compiling group assignments, including the final report. Together, the team crafted questions for usability testing, which I compiled and administered to a set of five volunteers. As this was an online class, the group communicated and collaborated online via Canvas. We were introduced to Jekyll, a static site generator, during the last few weeks of this course, which we were required to use along with command-line Git, which we also learned during the semester.</p>

LIS786 Final Report</p>

<h2>Outcome B</h2>

<p>Articulate the importance of project management for information management</p>

<p>In Fall 2016, Dominican University began the process of exploring a redesign of the university&rsquo;s website, dom.edu. Included in the scope of project were five subdomains for the university&rsquo;s then-existing graduate schools. A multi-year plan was developed detailing project phases, stakeholders involved and work plans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Phase I of the project involved migrating content from more than 1,000 pages from the current university website and subdomains into the new university website template. An outside web development company was hired to translate graphic design into code. A team of contractors joined the Office of Marketing and Communications staff to complete work. In order to keep projects with many moving parts on track, a variety of project management tools and methods were employed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Artifact</strong><br />
Work experience: Dominican University website redesign project</p>

<h2>Outcome C-4</h2>

<p>Apply technology to connect, communicate, and collaborate</p>

<p>For this outcome, I present my e-portfolio as my artifact. Using knowledge gained of Bootstrap in LIS 753, Internet Fundamentals and Design, I modified a Bootstrap template to my own design. Modern coding and information hierarchy learned in LIS 786, Advanced Web Design, also informed my e-portfolio design. Theories of information architecture, user interface design and user experience learned during my MSIM courses, alongside my work experience in digital communications and web best practices, all played a part in the planning, conceptualization, mockup and creation of this site.</p>
