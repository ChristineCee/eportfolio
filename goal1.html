<h1>Goal 1</h1>

<p>Develop a professional identity</p>

<h2>Outcome 1a</h2>

<p>Describe the historical foundations of information technologies and apply this knowledge to anticipate and plan for future developments</p>

<h4>Assignment: IM701 Issue/Trend Presentation</h4>

<p>The assignment: Examine a trend or issue by conducting a literature review and synthesizing your findings in a 15-minute presentation about the impact of the trend or issue on information management practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For this assignment, I chose to report on the trend of digital asset management in marketing operations. My presentation discussed how digital asset management evolved from record and document management systems and the need for new solutions to manage digital media, which is constantly changing. Digital assets were defined and various DAM systems were presented. The merits of using a digital asset management system for marketing purposes were presented: brand governance, version control and metrics among these. The presentation ended with a discussion on the skills needed to become a digital asset manager. Artifacts included are the presentation slides, bibliography and a tri-fold handout of important points and resources that was given to classmates during the presentation.</p>

<h2>Outcome 1b</h2>
<p>Identify the core values and ethics of the information professions</p>
<h4>Assignment: IM701 Case Study</h4>
<p> The assignment: Prepare a case study of a company or organization&rsquo;s information management leadership. Select a company or organization that interests you and research its information management practices using publicly available sources or information retrieved from the Crown Library databases. A case study usually involves the analysis of many components of a situation, but for this assignment you should highlight information management issues. Follow your overview with an analysis and discussion of the company/organization&rsquo;s information management leadership. Conclude your analysis and discussion with a set of recommended strategies that will improve the company/organization&rsquo;s operations, service(s), and/or product(s).&nbsp;</p>

<p>For this assignment, I chose to complete a case study on the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). I believe NARA&rsquo;s mission, vision and values illustrate the overall values and ethics of the information professions:</p>

<p>NARA&#39;s mission is to provide public access to U.S. Government records with the aim to strengthen the relationship between citizens and government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NARA&#39;s vision is to provide &quot;...greater meaning to the American experience&quot; through customer engagement and &quot;cutting-edge access to extraordinary volumes of government information.&quot;</p>

<p>NARA&#39;s values:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Collaborate: Create an open, inclusive work environment that is built on respect,&nbsp;communication, integrity, and collaborative teamwork.</li>
	<li>Innovate: Encourage creativity and invest in innovation to build our future.</li>
	<li>Learn: Pursue excellence through continuous learning and become smarter all thetime about what we know and what we do in service to others.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Source: NARA, &quot;About the National Archives: Our Mission and Vision,&quot; paragraph 1.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>At the core of the information professions is the belief in providing access to information. Some organizations, from government entities to local public libraries, build relationships with their communities and users through open access to information. Private companies, while perhaps not providing completely open public access to their information, offer access to their users: stakeholders, employees, customers. Public entities and private companies may share some similarities in information-sharing: user engagement that fosters greater communication and trust. They can enhance creativity and provide opportunities for innovation, learning, and participation &ndash; whether in government or a business setting.</p>

<p>NARA&rsquo;s strategic plan exemplifies what I believe to be core values of the information profession, as illustrated by the four goals below:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Make Access Happen: Establishes public access as NARA&#39;s primary goal, and challenges the agency to go beyond established service models and reach more users by providing easy-to-use digital tools.</li>
	<li>Connect with Customers: Learn from customers and build relationships with the public and users from other Federal agencies to promote crowdsourcing, elevate customer sentiment, and engage audiences through an enhanced outreach program.</li>
	<li>Maximize NARA&rsquo;s Value to the Nation: Support the transition to a digital government by creating modern records management policies, improve efficiencies through better business practices and create economic activity by encouraging public and commercial use of materials.</li>
	<li>Build Our Future through Our People: NARA is committed to fostering a 21st century workforce through diversity, enhanced training and a culture that rewards collaboration.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Outcome 1c</h2>
<p>Articulate a personal professional philosophy of the information professions</p>
<h4>Assignment: IM701 Information Manager Resume</h4>
<p> The assignment: 
<ol>
	<li>Develop a list of 8-10 core competencies and, for each competency, describe in 1-2 sentences why the competency is necessary for work in the information management field.</li>
	<li>Prepare a resume that uses core competencies from your list to highlight your work experience and education. It is not necessary to use all of the competencies on your list, and you may have some additional competencies that you note on your resume to present a full picture of your skill sets. Your resume should be no longer than 2 pages.</li>
</ol></p>
<p> For this assignment, I researched a variety of job listings for information profession positions, including knowledge manager, information manager, digital asset manager, and digital content manager, just to name a few. I then compared and compiled common skills and competencies from these job listings. Based on my 30+ years of work experience, ranging from public and academic libraries, large corporations and higher education, I arrived at a skill set that I believe information managers should possess, regardless of the type of position they hold or seek.</p>
<p> For the second part of this assignment, our class was instructed to rewrite our resumes, based on our list of core skills and competencies. My resume was revamped to highlight information management components of my current position, as well as other relevant positions.</p>
<p>Completting this assignment helped me form a personal philosophy of the information professions. While it is obviously necessary to obtain specialized education and training for fields such as web development, data analytics, digital asset management, etc., I firmly believe that "crossover" skills included on my list are equally important. In addition to training in their areas of specialty, information professionals also must be able to communicate effectively, think strategically, present findings, manage projects and collaborate as part of a team, along with the other skills listed on my paper.
