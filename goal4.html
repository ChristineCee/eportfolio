<h1>Goal 4</h1>

<p>Synthesize theory and practice within a dynamic and evolving information environment</p>

<h2>Outcome B</h2>

<p>Demonstrate application of theory to practice by finding, evaluating, and using information resources effectively for the solution of a variety of professional problems.</p>

<h4>Assignment: IM 750 Assignment 2 College Online Visibility Comparison &amp; Alternative Rankings</h4>

<p><em>The assignment: Dominican University stands at No. 19 in the U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings this year among 171 Midwest regional universities. Please retrieve the list of all Illinois institutions, which ranked higher than or tied with Dominican. Save their names and homepage address (URLs) from the above mentioned resource. For this assignment, we will evaluate these schools by their online visibility, traffic &amp; social media data (using the tools we introduced to retrieve publicly accessible data). Use tables to store your data and list them as appendix.</em></p>

<p><em>You need to compare the &quot;Alternate rankings&quot; with the U.S. News &amp; World Report one. Can we use the free online information as an alternative benchmark to rank universities belonging to the same category? Why? From the SEO and end/actual user&#39;s perspective, which university/college&#39;s homepage is the best and why?&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>As digital communications manager at Dominican University, this assignment was directly related to my position. In IM 750, we discussed methods and sources for retrieving&nbsp;public information from university websites and social media channels to replicate information in the&nbsp;<em>U.S. News &amp; World Report&nbsp;</em>college rankings. Using these publicly-accessible tools, along with sources I&rsquo;ve used in my job for social listening and competitive intelligence, I evaluated, compared and ranked Dominican University alongside the other colleges and universities in the &ldquo;Best Regional Universities in the Midwest&rdquo; tier.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Outcome C-1</h2>

<p>Identify and apply scholarly and professional research relevant to a topic in order to contextualize questions or problems</p>

<h4>Assignment: IM 791 Research Paper on Civic Engagement or Intercultural Communication</h4>

<p><em>The assignment: Students will review the literature on the topic of civic engagement or any of its components or on the diverse components of intercultural communication (see suggested topics below). Instructor must approve the topic before you begin your review. Students will write a 5-7 page paper in which they:</em></p>

<ol>
	<li><em>Describe the topic;</em></li>
	<li><em><em>Develop a thesis related to the topic; and&nbsp;</em></em></li>
	<li><em><em><em>Describe and substantiate their thesis.</em></em></em></li>
</ol>

<p>This research paper examines communication theory through the lens of information-seeking habits and communication preferences of prospective college students, particularly those who are the first in their families to attend college. Using readings from the class (a requirement of the assignment), and a variety of scholarly and professional resources, my paper presents a case for university websites to address the information needs of the growing segment of first-generation college students.</p>

<h2>Outcome C-2</h2>

<p>Identify and apply appropriate research methodologies to solve specific questions or issues</p>

<h4>Assignment: IM 791 Graphic or Visual Tool as Main Form of Communication</h4>

<p><em>The assignment: Communication also takes place through non-verbal communication or through graphics and images or other media. Students will focus on a graphic or visual presentation related to a particular topic. [Include] A one-page paper (minimum) in which you explain why you have chosen the particular strategy. In your paper, demonstrate your knowledge of one or more core concept(s) of the class from the reading material.</em></p>

<p>Continuing the research done for my IM 791 paper on first-generation college students, I chose to create an infographic for my graphic assignment. This infographic was designed to assist first-generation college students in finding information based on their specific needs, using existing and fictional resources at Dominican University. The infographic is intended to be used as a printed poster or on a website. The summary includes research on needs of first-generation college students, as well as research on color and design choices tailored to this audience.</p>
