<h1>Goal 3</h1>

<p>Envision, develop, manage, and curate information and its systems across the spectrum of human records from local to global contexts</p>

<h2>Outcome A</h2>

<p>Integrate a variety of theoretical and practice based concepts such as management and strategic planning to analyze, develop, and evaluate a variety of information technology solutions</p>

<h4>Assignment: IM 703, Information Architecture</h4>

<p>The assignment:&nbsp;For this project, you will chose an organization, either real or imagined.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will consider the nature of the business, the users of the products and services of the organization, the information required to deliver the products and run the operation, and new services that could be offered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I chose to create my information architecture assignment based on an imagined company, Sam&rsquo;s Fresh Market (SFM). My information architecture details SFM&rsquo;s business model: Sam&rsquo;s Fresh Market offers fresh produce from the farmer&rsquo;s market combined with&nbsp;specialty, ethnic and artisan products made with ingredients that are safe for consumerswith peanut and tree nut allergies. The company operates seven brick-and-mortar storesin the Chicagoland area, and promises customers fresh produce and unique, artisan&nbsp;products that are reasonably priced and guaranteed to be 100% nut-free.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also examined in this information architecture are SFM&rsquo;s competitors, customer personas and insights, new products that could be offered and recommended next steps. Detailed wireframes and mockups for desktop and mobile versions of a website are included.</p>

<h2>Outcome B</h2>

<p>Apply knowledge of system development concepts to design tools and systems that facilitate access to information and solve problems for a variety of organizations</p>

<h4>Assignment: IM 760, Final Project Report</h4>

<p>The assignment:&nbsp;The final project report is a document that describes all of the elements of your interface design including the user requirements, the organizational environment, technology constraints, interaction model, design motifs/aspects, usability evaluations, and screen images.</p>

<p>Taking the concept started in IM703 Information Architecture, I applied what I learned about information systems design and development to conceptualize a mobile app for Sam&rsquo;s Fresh Market. During the course of the semester, this app went through several iterations, starting with low-fi wireframes drawn on paper. Based on feedback from classmates, I chose to tie the mobile app to an employee wellness program for Sam&rsquo;s Fresh Market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My project report details the company&rsquo;s need for this solution, the goals of the company in creating and offering this app to employees, and what problems the app will solve. Also discussed are the design goals, features of the app, user requirements, and technology considerations. Usability testing and user personas are presented, and a case is made for design decisions (colors, text, images and layout) to provide a mobile experience that will make the user feel empowered, encouraged and positive about using the app during their health and fitness journey, which can be emotional and personal.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Outcome C</h2>

<p>Assess applicability of current and emerging technologies to information management</p>

<h4>Assignment: IM 760, Final Project Presentation of Interface Design</h4>

<p>The assignment:&nbsp;The final project is an interface to a system that you will design. You will develop and deliver an oral presentation of your final project, simulating presenting an interface design before a review committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;The presentations will be during class. Your presentation should be a 12 - 15 minute overview of your design. Please use a presentation software package like PowerPoint, Prezi, or Google to prepare slides. Screen shots or a demo of your web interface are highly recommended. Your slides should be informative and legible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be prepared to answer questions about your design.</p>

<p>For this assignment, I took my app concept and strategy to create a mobile app demo in Adobe XD. This allowed me to demonstrate the app&rsquo;s usability through a clickable prototype. Over the course of the semester, we discussed emerging technologies and the&nbsp;<em>Internet of Things</em>, and how that might inform the work we do as information managers and, for the purpose of this course, interface designers. This inspired me to create screen designs for both mobile phones and smart watches.&nbsp;</p>
